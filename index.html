<p>At <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2019">PyCon US 2019</a>, I was extremely honored to

<p>Everyone knows the story: armed with nothing more than a laptop and a dream, a couple of plucky geeks decide to take on the world: disrupting, innovating, and subverting their way to success.</p>
<p>But it isn't always like that. In fact, it <em>usually</em> isn't. This is a case study of one such a failure - TradesCloud. What went right? What went wrong? And what you can learn from TradesCloud's mistakes if you're contemplating starting a business of your own?</p>
