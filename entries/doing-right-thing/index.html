<h1>Doing the right thing</h1>
<p>My life has been fairly busy of late. My daughter was born on June 19; Django v1.1 is almost out the door; and we have lots of <a class="reference external" href="http://wotnews.com.au">interesting</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://wotnews.com">stuff</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://wotnews.co.uk">underway</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://wearehunted.com">work</a>.</p>
<p>So, when <a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> contacted me asking if I would like to review their recently released book, I declined. I barely have enough time to read books at the moment, let alone review them.</p>
<p>However, I asked if I could have a complimentary copy anyway. After all - I am a Django core developer, and if I (and many other people) hadn't volunteered my time to develop Django, Packt wouldn't have a topic to publish a book about.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they agreed. Sitting on my hard disk is a freshly downloaded copy of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/django-1.0-template-design-practical-guide/book">&quot;Django 1.0 Template Development&quot;, by Scott Newman</a>. If Django template development sounds like something you might be interested in knowing more about, and you want to know more about this book, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/django-1-0-template-development-sample-chapter-6-serving-multiple-template">sample chapter is available</a>.</p>
<p>I find this kind of attitude encouraging. It would have been very easy to dismiss my request, but Packt took the opportunity to give a little something back to the community that enables them to derive financial benefit. In this case, it quite literally costs them nothing: it's an e-book, so there's no physical costs; I'm hardly the target audience, so this doesn't represent a lost sale opportunity. However, the gesture does gain Packt a lot of goodwill in my eyes.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like this sort of thing to become commonplace, rather than the exception. Donating five or ten books out of a print run to the core developers that maintain a project would hardly be a big expense for a major publisher, but it would mean a lot to the people (such as myself) that volunteer countless hours of their own time to manage and maintain open source projects.</p>
<p>Packt Publishing - I salute you. However, I also encourage you to make this a broader policy, not just a once-off offer to someone who took a chance by asking when approached. I call on other publishers to follow the example of Packt in this instance.</p>
<p>Of course, it need not stop at donated books, either. Financial or other contributions to fundraising foundations (such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com/foundation">Django Foundation</a> would also be most welcome. I appreciate that this is a much harder sell, as it involves talking about real money. However, the issue runs deeper than an accounting line item.</p>
<p>As with many discussions about rights (be they human rights or intellectual property rights), the parallel issue of responsibilities is often overlooked. Yes, every human has certain inalienable rights - but those rights come with the responsibility of participating and contributing to their culture as a whole. This principle of responsibility was sufficiently important that it was enshrined as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Section 29.1 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, while Open Source software comes with the right of free (as in beer and as in speech) use and redistribution, there is a responsibility to give back. For the individual, this can mean contributing help on a mailing list or IRC channel, or contributing patches. For corporations, this can be as simple as allowing employees to use company time to contribute to projects. Financial and in-kind contributions are another option. When the business model of a company is entirely based on leveraging open source products - such as publishing companies with an Open Source focus, or service companies that use Open Source exclusively - I believe there is a strong moral imperative to contribute in a meaningful and substantive way back to the communities that make their companies possible.</p>
<p>Packt has made one small step down this road. I'm proud to say that <a class="reference external" href="http://wotnews.com.au">Wotnews</a>, the company where I hang my shingle, is a company that has not only started down the road, but is now getting Frequent Flyer points for their travels. Right now, I'm in the process of organizing travel to <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.org">DjangoCon09</a>, and Wotnews has offered - for the second year in a row - to pick up the tab for my flight and conference expenses. Given that I'm based in Perth, and the conference is in Portland, this is a substantial contribution.</p>
<p>Stephen Phillips and Richard Slatter (Founder and General Manager, respectively, of Wotnews) were under no obligation to contribute in this way - or in any other way, for that matter - but they have taken the opportunity to give something back to the community that has provided the foundation for their own company. As a result, DjangoCon09 will benefit from having a core developer in attendance that wouldn't otherwise be able to make it.</p>
<p>The gesture is also deeply appreciated on a personal level. It's difficult to measure the depths of my gratitude to Stephen and Richard for running a company they way they do. Not only have they built a great team and work environment, but they fully acknowledge their responsibility to give back to the open source projects like Django that contribute to the success of Wotnews. I can only hope that if I am ever in a comparable position, I live up to the example that they have established in Wotnews.</p>
