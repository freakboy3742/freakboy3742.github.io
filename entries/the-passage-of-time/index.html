<h1>The passage of time</h1>
<div class="section" id="years-ago">
<h2>20 years ago...</h2>
<p>20 years ago, <em>to the day</em>, I received a short email from Adrian Holovaty:</p>
<blockquote>
Would you be interested in commit access on the Django magic-removal branch? We've really appreciated your contributions lately and would love to see more.</blockquote>
<p>With that, I became a member of the Django core team. I couldn't have predicted how that email would change my life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="years-ago-1">
<h2>18 years ago...</h2>
<p>18 years ago, not <em>quite</em> to the day (25 January 2008), I received a short email from Stephen Phillips, founder of a new Django-based startup in the media space. They wanted to bring some Django expertise in house, and I was a notable member of the Django Core team.</p>
<p>However, they were based in Brisbane. I said I had no interest in relocating... so he offered me the job as a remote employee. I've been a remote employee every since.</p>
<p>The company was called Plugger; it was renamed to Wotnews not long after I joined, and became WeAreHunted before I left. As well as a bunch of experience in a startup environment, I got my first exposure to iOS development - we developed <a class="reference external" href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/myspace-music-romeo--the-free-ipad-app-that-matches-music-to-your-mood/news-story/e0a23e116a056cdf644d113254fe02fc">MySpace's first iPad app</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="years-ago-2">
<h2>15 years ago...</h2>
<p>15 years ago, <em>to the day</em>, I made the first commit to the repository that became TradesCloud. The startup bug had got a hold of me, and my co-founder and I were convinced that we had an idea that was a winner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="years-ago-3">
<h2>11 years ago...</h2>
<p>It turns out it wasn't. And the pressure of trying to keep the lights on in a failing startup, plus a bunch of other things going on in my life, meant I was in the middle of a major depressive episode. I didn't actually seek professional help until around April of 2015.</p>
<p>However, along the way, I had also hit a technical limitation with Django - I needed a mobile app. A mobile-enabled PWA wasn't up to the task, and I didn't have the time or resources to develop <em>both</em> an iOS and Android app. All my company's business logic was written in Python... so why couldn't I use Python to write my mobile app? Someone should do something about that...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="years-ago-4">
<h2>9 years ago...</h2>
<p>9 years ago, around this day, I was in the process of shutting down TradesCloud. We had made the decision to shut down TradesCloud just before Christmas, and we <a class="reference external" href="../autopsy-of-a-slow-train-wreck">turned off the lights on January 31 2017</a>.</p>
<p>But it wasn't a complete loss - by this point, <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org">BeeWare</a> was in development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="years-ago-5">
<h2>4 years ago...</h2>
<p>4 years ago, <em>on this day</em>, I received an email to reschedule a meeting with Kevin Goldsmith and Stan Seibert at Anaconda to speak about BeeWare. This was the fourth meeting I'd taken in the previous 2 months from Anaconda staff... and I was so flattered that they were interested in the project I founded that it had not yet occurred to me that I had been having job interviews.</p>
<p>Just over a month later, I accepted a job offer to join the Anaconda Open Source team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="today">
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>The last 20 years has been a wild ride. It has, at times, taken an emotional toll; and being geographically isolated has been difficult - especially when leaving my home city was almost impossible for 2 years due to worldwide lockdowns.</p>
<p>However, I have also done things in my professional life that I never could have imagined I would have the opportunity to do. The work I've done has had an impact on every continent on this planet, and on <em>other</em> planets. I've seen my work used by multi-billion dollar companies, and I've seen it used by not-for-profit groups to have a profound impact on the world.</p>
<p>More importantly, I've made friends all around the world, who I love with all my heart. I don't get to see you all in person anywhere near as often as I want to; but that doesn't mean I love you all any less.</p>
<p>But for an email 20 years ago, none of this would have happened. At the very least, it would have been radically different - given the state of the tech industry in Perth, it's difficult to believe my career would have had an even remotely comparable trajectory was it not for stumbling onto a freshly open-sourced web framework in late 2005. I can't begin to thank Adrian and Jacob enough for the faith they showed in me all those years ago in offering me commit access to Django. I hope I have been able to pay forward even a fraction of what you gave me by sending that email.</p>
