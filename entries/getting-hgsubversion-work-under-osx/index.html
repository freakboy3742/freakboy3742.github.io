<h1>Getting hgsubversion to work under OSX</h1>
<p>I've been using git as a DVCS for about a year. One of the big selling points for git has been git-svn - a compatibility layer between Subversion repositories and the git client. This means you can continue to use your old SVN repository to store your code, but interact with it using a modern DVCS tool that allows for local (and offline) commits, local branches, etc.</p>
<p>This has been an absolute godsend for my work with Django. Local commits, local branches, and git-stash have all become an indispensable part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>However, git isn't the only DVCS. Of late, I've been experimenting with Mercurial. Mercurial doesn't ship with a direct equivalent of git-svn, but it does have a very robust plugin framework. One of the plugins that is available is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/wiki/Home">hgsubversion</a> - a plugin that lets you treat a Subversion repository as if it were a public Mercurial repository.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, Ben Collins-Sussman <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=116">wrote a document</a> describing how to get hgsubversion working. However, that document appears to refer to an older version of hgsubversion, as some of the commands no longer appear relevant. It's also a more generic Unix tutorial, so it tends towards &quot;compile the sources&quot; as a solution for dependencies. When you have a stable binary platform like OSX, there is usually an easier way.</p>
<p>For the benefit of my own memory later on, and for the benefit of anyone else in the same boat, here's an updated set of instructions, slightly tuned for OSX. The basic procedure should work for any other operating system, but you'll need to work out how to adapt the instructions for your local conditions.</p>
<div class="section" id="install-mercurial">
<h2>Install Mercurial</h2>
<p>First, Install Mercurial. You need to have version 1.3 or greater. The default OSX installer works fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="install-subversion">
<h2>Install Subversion</h2>
<p>hgsubversion requires the binding API from Subversion 1.5 or greater. CollabNet <a class="reference external" href="http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/community/">publishes an OSX installer for Subversion</a> that won't collide with the system version. Download and install this package. It will install Subversion 1.5 into <cite>/opt/subversion</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-the-shell-environment">
<h2>Configure the shell environment</h2>
<p>In order for hgsubversion to know about the non-standard Subversion install, you need to configure the shell environment to point at the new version. Set the following environment variables so that hgsubversion can find the Subversion 1.5 bindings:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/subversion/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export PYTHONPATH=/opt/subversion/lib/svn-python:$PYTHONPATH
</pre>
<p>You can set these in a normal shell session, or, if you intend to make this a permanent arrangement, you can add these lines to <cite>~/.bash_profile</cite>. If you take the <cite>.bash_profile</cite> option, you would also be well advised to set the <cite>PATH</cite> so that the right subversion binary is available:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ export PATH=/opt/subversion/bin:$PATH
</pre>
<p>To check that this has worked, run the following at a shell prompt:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python -c &quot;import svn.core; print svn.core.SVN_VER_MINOR&quot;
</pre>
<p>You should get a response of <cite>5</cite> or <cite>6</cite>. If you get <cite>4</cite>, you're still using the default 1.4 install of Subversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="install-hgsubversion">
<h2>Install hgsubversion</h2>
<p>hgsubversion is available as a Mercurial checkout. I put my tool checkouts into <tt class="docutils literal">~/tools</tt>; any other location will do (provided you adapt the later instructions):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd tools
$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-hgsubversion">
<h2>Configure hgsubversion</h2>
<p>To enable the hgsubversion plugin, edit your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.hgrc</span></tt> file and add the following lines to the <tt class="docutils literal">[extensions]</tt> section:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rebase=
svn=/Users/rkm/tools/hgsubversion/hgsubversion
</pre>
<p>Substitute your own home directory for <tt class="docutils literal">/Users/rkm</tt>; if you used a directory other that <tt class="docutils literal">~/tools</tt>, modify as appropriate. The important thing to note is that you're not referencing the hgsubversion directory that you cloned - you're referencing the hgsubversion directory <em>inside</em> the directory that you cloned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clone-your-svn-repository">
<h2>Clone your SVN repository</h2>
<p>Now you can clone your repository. For example, a public HTTP repository for a Google Code project could be cloned using:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg clone svn+http://&lt;project-name&gt;.googlecode.com/svn project
</pre>
<p>This will make a clone of the repository into a directory named <tt class="docutils literal">project</tt>. Note that the checkout <em>doesn't</em> contain the <tt class="docutils literal">trunk</tt> part of the repository URL.</p>
<p>You can also clone a password-protected repository. Again, using Google Code as an example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg clone svn+https://&lt;project-name&gt;.googlecode.com/svn project
</pre>
<p>It's important to note the use of <tt class="docutils literal">svn+https</tt>. If you leave off the <tt class="docutils literal">svn+</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg clone https://&lt;project-name&gt;.googlecode.com/svn project
</pre>
<p>This will still work - however,  hgsubversion won't retain your HTTP credentials, so you'll need to re-enter them multiple times every time you pull or push updates.</p>
<p>The cloning process will create a complete clone of every commit, every branch, and every tag, so this can take a while. If the clone is interrupted at any point (say, due to a network outage), you can resume the update with a simple <tt class="docutils literal">hg pull</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-your-repository">
<h2>Use your repository</h2>
<p>Now you can use your repository. After editing some source files, you can commit, then push your changes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg commit
$ hg push
</pre>
<p>This push will turn into a full subversion commit with the same commit message you gave to Mercurial. To retrieve repository updates:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg pull
$ hg update
</pre>
<p>or, if you have the fetch extension installed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ hg fetch
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caveats">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>The one notable limitation of hgsubversion is that requires that your subversion repository follow the basic convention of having the root directories <tt class="docutils literal">/trunk</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">/branches</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">/tags</tt>. However, structure inside those directories doesn't appear to matter (at least, a lot less than it matters with git-svn).</p>
<p>For example, I was able to clone the complete Django repository. The repository contains represents SVN trunk as the <tt class="docutils literal">default</tt> branch, and creates internal branches for each of the branches for each, and ended up with a repository where <tt class="docutils literal">trunk</tt> is the <tt class="docutils literal">default</tt> branch, and each of the SVN branches are represented in the clone:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it. I used git for the life of the v1.1 branch of Django. Now that I have a viable SVN clone in Mercurial, I'm aiming to use Mercurial for my work on the v1.2 branch. We'll have to wait and see which one wins out for v1.3.</p>
