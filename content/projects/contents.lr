`BeeWare <https://beeware.org>`__ is a collection of projects that can be used
to help develop, debug and launch Python software. Each tool follows the Unix
philosophy of doing one thing well. Each tool can be used in isolation, or they
can be chained together to provide a rich set of programming tools.

If you want to get involved contributing to the BeeWare project, there are
`guides to walk you through the process <https://beeware.org/contributing/>`_.
Contributions are welcomed from everyone - of all levels of experience, and
areas of expertise, and mentoring is availalbe. All contributors are eligible
to receive a `BeeWare challenge coin <https://beeware.org/contributing
/challenge-coins/>`_.

The BeeWare project is also seeking your financial assistance. If you use the
BeeWare project tools, or would like to see them develop, I encourage you to
`become a financial member of the project
<https://beeware.org/contributing/membership/>`_.

`Django <https://djangoproject.com>`__ is a high-level Python Web framework that
encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced
developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can
focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and
open source. It's the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
